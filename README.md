Lumee is an image viewer based on browsing folders of images. Developed with
GTK+ and designed for GNOME 3, it aims to have an unobtrusive and minimalist
UI.

Lumee is still early in development, so it's missing some basic features for
now. To compile, run `make` with C++ standard library and gtkmm headers
installed.
